The files in this directory are for setup purposes.

Copy the `packages` directory to your houdini setup directory, likely in `Documents\houdinix.x`, 
if there is already a `packages` directory in there it is safe paste it in the same directory, 
it should merge the directories.

You then need to modify the contents of the `HTTGT.json` file inside that `packages` directory 
replacing the file path to the path where you installed this toolset to.
It should point to the `packages` directory at the root of the toolset, not the one under `setup`
