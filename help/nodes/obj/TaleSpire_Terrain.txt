= TaleSpire Terrain =

"""The main node for creating a terrain for TaleSpire."""

== Overview ==
Controls and sub-networks for creating and exporting a terrain to TaleSpire.

@parameters
=== Map Setup ===
Terrain Name:
    #id: terrain_name

    The name used to store data on disk. The default, $OS, uses the name of the node.

Terrain Size:
    #id: terrain_size

    The size of the map in tiles in both X and Z.  Y being Up.

Max Tile Stack:
    #id: terrain_stack_max

    The maximum number of tiles to stack under the surface tile, this will fill vertical gaps in steep terrain.

==== Water ====
Enable Water Plane:
    #id: enable_water

    When enabled, the water plane is used within the system.

Show Water Plane:
    #id: show_water

    When enabled, the water plane is visible in the viewport.

Water Plane Level:
    #id: water_level

    The height of the water plane. For interactivity, you may want to turn off "Enable Water Plane" while adjusting this.

Max Water Tile Depth:
    #id: water_stack_max

    The maximum number of tiles to stack under the water surface.

Enable Water Tile Generation:
    #id: enable_water_tile_gen

    When enabled, water tiles will be generated when needed.

Exclude Water Tiles Below Water Plane:
    #id: exclude_tiles_below_water_plane

    When enabled, and the water plane is active, no water tiles will be generated under the water plane.

==== Ground ====
Show TS Board Level:
    #id: show_ground

    When enabled, the board level (Ground Plane) in TaleSpire will be shown.

Automatically Determine Board Level:
    #id: auto_ground_plane

    When enabled, the ground plane will be automatically set slighly under the lowest asset on the map.

Board Level:
    #id: ground_level

    The height of the ground plane.
=== Display Options ===
Display Heightfield Terrain:
    #id: display_terrain

    Toggles visibility of the heightfield terrain.

Display Tiles:
    #id: display_tiles

    Toggles visibility of the surface tiles of the terrain.

Display Props:
    #id: display_props

    Toggles visibility of the props/objects on the terrain.

Textured Tiles:
    #id: textured_tiles

    Toggles the visibility of textured floor tiles.

BBOX LOD Size Cutoff:
    #id: bbox_lod_vis_size

    A threshold for turning off the display of objects represented by bounding boxes based on their size.
    The higher this value, large and larger bounding boxes will be hidden from view but the objects will still be exported.

=== Edit ===
Edit Terrain:
    #id: edit_terrain

    Navigates to the terrain editing network to sculpt the terrain and setup masks.

Build/Cache Terrain Tiles:
    #id: cache_terrain_tiles

    Re-calculates and saves out the base tiles for the terrain.
    This builds the 1x1 and 2x2 tiles of the surface terrain, it should be done every time the terrain is edited,
    and when new biomes are defined or biome masks are changed.

Edit Biomes:
    #id: edit_biomes

    Navigates to the biomes network to create and edit the TaleSpire_Biome nodes that populate the terrain.

=== Export ===

==== Limit Area ====
Export Limited Area:
    #id: export_limited_area

    When enabled, exporting of the map will be limited to an area defined by the "Bounding Box Geo"

Bounding Box Geo:
    #id: limit_bbox_geo

    The path to an object to use as the bounding box to limit the area of the map to be exported.
    A houdini object node can be dragged into this field to link it.

==== Slab Orientation and Order ====
Show North:
    #id: show_north

    Toggles the visibility of an arrow over the terrain that points North.

North Direction:
    #id: north_dir

    Sets the north direction of the map.

Reorient Slab Order:
    #id: reorient_slab_order

    Uses the "North Direction" to re-orient the slabs so the slabs are placed from West to East and North to South.

Zig Zag Slab Order:
    #id: zig_zag_slab_order

    Reverses the order of the slabs every other row, so if you are placing slabs manually you don't have to move your camera as far.
==== Export Controls ====
Display Slab Bounds:
    #id: display_current_slab

    Toggles the visibility of the bounding box of the current slab.

Slab Size:
    #id: slabsize

    Sets the max size of the slabs to be exported. If you get a slab size error when exporting this will need to be lowered.

Get Slab Index Range:
     #id: set_slab_range

     Calculates how many slabs are needed, based off the the "Slabe Size", and sets the Slab Index range.

Slab Index:
    #id: slabindex

    Two fields that depict the currently active slab and the total number of slabs.

Use Registration Marks:
    #id: use_reg_marks

    When enabled, registration tiles will be exported along with the slab. These are red tiles below the surface of the
    slab that help with manually placing the slabs in TaleSpire.

Copy Current Slab:
    #id: copy_current_slab

    Copies the currently active slab to the clipboard so it can be pasted into TaleSpire.

Copy Slab and Advance:
    #id: copy_slab_plus

    Copies the currently active slab to the clipboard and advances the slab index to the next slab.
    This allows you to repeatedly press this button to manually place every slab in the map.

Multi Copy Slabs:
    #id: multi_copy_slabs

    Copies all slabs to the clipboard at once. This requires the Multi-Paste Slabs mod to paste into TaleSpire but saves a ton of time.
==== Multi Slab Offset ====
Offset:
    #id: multi_slab_offset

    When using "Multi Copy Slabs" this offset applies to the entire map within TaleSpire.

=== Attributions ===
Generate:
    #id: generate_attributions

    Analyzes all the slabs used to make this map and generates a list of attributions.

Copy to Clipboard:
    #id: clip_attributions

    Copies the list of attributions to the clipboard so they can be pasted elsewhere.

Attributions:
    #id: attribution_string

    The attributions generated. To utilizes attributions they must be set on the TaleSpire_Object nodes in your biomes.
=== Settings ===
==== Configs ====
Refresh Configs:
    #id: cfg_refresh

    Reloads the configs from disk in case they were changed while this file was open.

TaleSpire Directory:
    #id: cfg_talespire_directory

    The base directory of where TaleSpire is installed on the filesystem. The toolset will not work if TaleSpire is not installed on the same machine.

Textured Tiles Enabled by Default:
    #id: cfg_textured_tiles

    If enabled, all new TaleSpire_Terrain nodes will have textured_tiles enabled when placed.

==== Hacks ====
Force Recook all the things!:
    #id: cook_the_things

    Forces a recook of the terrain and biomes in case things are not looking as expected.
    This shouldn't have to be used much anymore, most of the re-cooking issues have been dealt with.
