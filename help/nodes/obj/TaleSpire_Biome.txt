"""Defines a Biome which controls what TaleSpire Tiles and Props get put on to the terrain."""
=== Overview ===
Defines a TaleSpire biome.

All biomes except for the one marked "Default Biome" in the Biome Settings require a mask. These masks are set in the
"Terrain Edit" area of the TaleSpire_Terrain node and accessible from the "Biome Mask Layer Name" on this node.

NOTE:
    When you set a node as the "Default Biome" it will disable that option on all other nodes in this network, however,
    if you copy a node from somewhere else that has this toggle enabled you could end up with two biomes set as the
    default biome and end up with unpredictable results.

If this node is a sub-biome of another biome node, check the "Use as Sub-Biome" option, this will access the
"Sub-Biome Settings" panel for more options.

== Sub-Biomes ==
Sub-Biomes do not place tiles or props like a normal biome, these networks can be ignored or their contents deleted.
Instead of placing objects the sub-biome just instructs the main biome which objects to swap out. In
"Edit Biome Objects", keep all the network boxes and objects in place with the same names but change the assets the
TaleSpire_Object nodes are accessing.

The point of a sub-biome is to replace the existing objects in the biome with different objects in the defined regions.
So you can make a winter version of a map keeping all the trees and bushes in place and just changing them with
something else.

@parameters
== General ==
Disable Biome:
    #id: disable_biome

    If enabled this biome will not be used.

Use as Sub-Biome:
    #id: enable_sub_biome

    If enabled this biome will be used as a sub-biome.

Biome Mask Layer Name:
    #id: biome_layer_name

    The name of the heightfield layer to use as a mask for defining the region of this biome.

Biome Priority:
    #id: biome_priority

    Priority for when biomes overlap. The higher priority will be applied in the case where the biome masks are equal.

== Biome Settings ==
Default Biome:
    #id: default_biome

    Defines this as the default biome, which means it applies to everything that isn't defined in another biome.
    There should be only a single default biome defined in a terrain. If you enable this on one biome it will automatically be disabled on all other biomes in the same network.

Scattering:
    #id: biome_exclusion

    Sets the default scattering behavior for the biome. The default, "Excludes Other Biomes", will only scatter objects
    within the current biome. Setting this to "Includes Other Biomes" will cause the biome to scatter objects into all
    other biomes. This can be overridden on individual TaleSpire_Scatter nodes.

Sub Biomes:
    #id: sub_biomes

    Sets the number of sub-biomes to use.

Sub Biome Node:
    #id: sub_biome_#

    The path to another biome node to be used as a sub-biome. The referenced biome should have "Use as Sub-Biome" set.

== Sub-Biome Settings ==
Mask Threshold:
    #id: sb_mask_threshold

    If the mask value is above this threshold it will be included in the sub-biome.

Mask Jitter:
    #id: sb_mask_jitter

    Noise added to the mask to randomize the edge of biomes. This works best if your mask has a large feather to the edge.

== Navigation ==
Edit Biome Objects:
    #id: edit_objects

    Navigates to the sub-network to define the TaleSpire objects used to define this biome.

Edit Biome Masks:
    #id: edit_masks

    Navigates to the sub-network to define layer masks for this biome, the masks set in here can be accessed in both the
    tile and props networks.

Edit Tiles:
    #id: edit_tiles

    Navigates to the sub-network to define where tiles are placed on the terrain.

Edit Props:
    #id: edit_props

    Navigates to the sub-network to define where objects are placed/scattered on the terrain.
~~~
Refresh Biome:
    #id: refresh_biome
    When changing the objects and sets in the "Edit Objects" area it is sometimes necessary to use this button to refresh the biome.
