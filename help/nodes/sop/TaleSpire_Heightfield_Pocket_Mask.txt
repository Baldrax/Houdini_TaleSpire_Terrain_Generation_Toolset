"""Creates a mask by scattering spheres on the terrain."""
=== Overview ===
Create masks in pockets with control over density and distance.

@parameters
== Shape Parameters ==
Scale:
    #id: shap_scale

    Overall scale of the shapes being scattered.

Scale Range:
    #id: shape_scale_range

    Each shape will be randomly scaled between these two values.

Noise Amp:
    #id: shape_namp

    Amplitude of the noise applied to each shape, a value of 0 will make each shape a sphere.

Noise Element Size:
    #id: shape_elementsize

    The frequency of the noise applied to each shape.

== Scatter Parameters ==
Density:
    #id: scat_density

    The density of the scattered pockets across the surface.

Outer Radius:
    #id: scat_outerradius

    Minimum distance each shape center should be from another shape.

Seed:
    #id: scatter_seed

    The random seed offset for scattering and shape noise.

Randomize seed per node:
    #id: seed_add_name

    When enabled, each instance of this node will get a different random seed. This is combined with the Seed value
    above.
    Renaming the node will also change the seed as it is based on the full path to the node.

== Post Operations ==
Invert:
    #id: maskinvert

    Inverts the result of the mask.

Convert Mask to Height:
    #id: post_to_height

    The mask is copied into the height layer, overriding the incoming height of the terrain.

Remove Mask:
    #id: post_height_no_mask

    Clears the mask layer, only available if "Convert Mask to Height" is enabled.
