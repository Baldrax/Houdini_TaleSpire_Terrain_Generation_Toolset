= TaleSpire Heightfield Tile Edge Mask =

"""Creates a mask based on the tile edges of the ground terrain."""
=== Overview ===
Defines a mask based on the tile edges of the ground terrain. Useful for scattering additional objects to mask
the height transition of tiles.

NOTE:
    This node only works if it is inside a biome within a TaleSpire Terrain node.

@parameters
== General ==
Tile Divisions:
    #id: resscale

    The number of times to divide the heightmap by based on the original tiles.

Edge Smooth Radius:
    #id: smoothradius

    Amount (in voxels) to smooth the edge by.

Output Uses Mask Resolution:
    #id: output_mask_res

    Output using the resolution of the mask instead of the input resolution.
    This is recommended unless your input resolution is higher.

Output Tile Heights:
    #id: output_tile_height

    Output the height of the tiles instead of the incoming height.
